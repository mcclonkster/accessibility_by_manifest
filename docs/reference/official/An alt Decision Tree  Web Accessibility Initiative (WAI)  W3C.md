-   **Does the image contain text?**
    -   **Yes:**
        -   **… and the text is also present as _real_ text nearby.** _Use an empty `alt` attribute. See [Decorative Images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decorative/)._
        -   **… and the text is only shown for visual effects.** _Use an empty `alt` attribute. See [Decorative Images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decorative/)._
        -   **… and the text has a specific function, for example is an icon.** _Use the `alt` attribute to communicate the function of the image. See [Functional Images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/functional/)._
        -   **… and the text in the image is not present otherwise.** _Use the `alt` attribute to include the text of the image. See [Images of Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/textual/#styled-text-decorative-effect)._
    -   **No:**
        -   Continue.
-   **Is the image used in a link or a button, and would it be hard or impossible to understand what the link or the button does, if the image wasn’t there?**
    -   **Yes:**
        -   _Use the `alt` attribute to communicate the destination of the link or action taken. See [Functional Images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/functional/)._
    -   **No:**
        -   Continue.
-   **Does the image contribute meaning to the current page or context?**
    -   **Yes:**
        -   **… and it’s a simple graphic or photograph.** _Use a brief description of the image in a way that conveys that meaning in the `alt` attribute. See [Informative Images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/informative/)._
        -   **… and it’s a graph or complex piece of information.** _Include the information contained in the image elsewhere on the page. See [Complex Images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/complex/)._
        -   **… and it shows content that is redundant to _real_ text nearby.** _Use an empty `alt` attribute. See (redundant) [Functional Images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/functional/#logo-image-within-link-text)._
    -   **No:**
        -   Continue.
-   **Is the image purely decorative or not intended for users?**
    -   **Yes:**
        -   _Use an empty `alt` attribute. See [Decorative Images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decorative/)._
    -   **No:**
        -   Continue.
-   **Is the image’s use not listed above or it’s unclear what `alt` text to provide?**
    -   This decision tree **does not** cover all cases. For detailed information on the provision of text alternatives refer to the [Images Tutorial](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/).
